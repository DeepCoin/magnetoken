What is MagneTokens?
------------------

MagneTokens is an experimental cryptocurrency adapted for use as a decentralized
[Magnet Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) distribution
platform for a variety of applications. It utilizes Primecoin's prime chain 
proof-of-work scheme for securing the blockchain and Bitcoin's well known payment
processing methods.


ToDo List
========

* Add magnet link functions to the blockchain (similar to florin's tx comments)
* GUI modification allow raw paste and build-your-own links to tx
* Method to allow for for null destination tx (datacoin does this i believe)
* GUI modification to properly display links with dn= attribute
* Index page for browsing all links in the blockchain
* built-in magnet handler? (control which links are opened by which applications)
* more?
